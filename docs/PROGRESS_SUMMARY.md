# TruLoad Project Progress Report

**Report Date:** May 21, 2026
**Project:** TruLoad - Intelligent Weighing & Enforcement Solution
**Overall Completion:** 98%
**Current Version:** v1.3.1

---

## Executive Summary

TruLoad is a cloud-hosted intelligent weighing and enforcement platform enabling roadside officers to capture vehicle weights, verify compliance with EAC Vehicle Load Control Act (2016) and Kenya Traffic Act (Cap 403), and manage enforcement actions including prosecution and special releases.

### Key Achievements
- Robust backend foundation with 120+ API endpoints
- Complete case management and special release workflows with approval/rejection
- Legal compliance engines for EAC and Kenya Traffic Acts
- Professional PDF document generation system (9 document types)
- 77-permission authorization framework with Redis caching
- Complete axle grouping aggregation with tolerance logic (Sprint 11)
- Demerit points system fully implemented
- **Frontend weighing UI fully wired to backend (95% complete)**
- **Mobile & Multideck pages integrated with transaction API**
- **Entity creation (Driver, Transporter) wired to backend**
- **Decision panel actions (Tag, Yard) fully integrated with case linking**
- **Yard Management with dedicated service layer (100% complete)**
- **Vehicle Tags with automatic case register integration**
- **Security page fully wired (Password Policy, 2FA, Backup/Restore)**
- **Application Settings system with in-memory caching**
- **Two-Factor Authentication service (TOTP, recovery codes)**
- **Database backup & restore service (pg_dump/psql)**
- **Apache Superset analytics integration (dashboards, text-to-SQL via Ollama)**
- TruConnect middleware production-ready (95%)

### Current Phase
Production deployed (v1.3.1). Multi-tenant architecture live with kura (kuraweigh DB) and truload tenants. All tenant databases auto-migrated and seeded on startup. Commercial weighing workflows complete. Focus on monitoring, tolerance precision, and documentation accuracy.

### v1.3.1 Fixes (May 21, 2026)
- **Tolerance precedence corrected** — `CalculateGroupToleranceAsync` now evaluates config-specific `ToleranceKg`/`TolerancePercentage` first (was #3, now #1). Per-config overrides always win over global Act tolerances.
- **Axle tolerance display fixed** — weight tickets show `X,XXX kg (config)` when a per-config axle tolerance is active (was always `0% (strict)`)
- **Standard config tolerance update unblocked** — `PUT /AxleConfiguration/{id}` now accepts tolerance/notes updates on standard (EAC) configs without returning 400
- **Tenant DB auto-migration** — all dedicated tenant DBs (kuraweigh, etc.) migrated and seeded automatically on startup via `TenantConnectionStringProvider.GetDedicatedTenantDatabases()`

### v1.3.0 Features (May 20, 2026)
- Commercial two-pass resume flow (`/pending-by-plate/{regNo}`)
- Stale transaction Hangfire notification job (30 min interval, dedup via `StaleAlertSentAt`)
- Subscription validation on weighing initiation (HTTP 402 for inactive subscription)
- Treasury pay portal URL from config (`Treasury:PayPortalBaseUrl`)
- Completion and tolerance exception email notifications to transporter / station managers

### v1.2.0 Features (April 22, 2026)
- Driver + owner joint-liability charge split (Cap 403 / EAC VLC)
- Special release approval queue (supervisor workflow)
- Vehicle registration normalisation

### Sprint 23 - Module Access Audit & Security Hardening (March 20, 2026)

**Report Filtering by Module Access (Commercial Mode)**
- Report catalog endpoint now filters by org's enabled modules and tenant type
- Commercial tenants only see weighing and security reports (not prosecution, cases, yard, financial)
- Cache key includes org ID for per-tenant catalog caching
- GenerateReport endpoint validates module access before generating

**Document Generation - Flexible Org Logo**
- All non-legal documents now use org-specific logo with fallback chain: org logo → truload-logo.png → kura-logo.png
- Logo dimensions increased: primary 120x90px (was 85x65), report 80x60px (was 55x45)
- Applied to: WeightTicket, Invoice, Receipt, ComplianceCertificate, LoadCorrectionMemo, SpecialReleaseCertificate, BaseReportDocument
- Legal documents (ChargeSheet, CourtMinutes, ProhibitionOrder) retain government/judicial logos
- Added `BrandingConstants.Logos.TruLoadLogo` constant for default fallback

**Logout Flow Hardening**
- Backend logout now clears ASP.NET Identity cookie (`TruLoad.Auth`) via `HttpContext.SignOutAsync()`

**SSO Auth Flow - Cross-Org Login Prevention**
- SsoExchange endpoint no longer JIT-reassigns existing users to a different org
- Returns 403 `org_mismatch` if user belongs to a different org than the SSO-resolved org
- Prevents unauthorized cross-tenant access via SSO

**CORS Configuration**
- Added `accounts.codevertexitsolutions.com` and `sso.codevertexitsolutions.com` to allowed origins
- Added `truload.codevertexitsolutions.com` to appsettings.json dev defaults

**Commercial Mode - Financial Modules & Invoices/Receipts**
- Added `financial_invoices` and `financial_receipts` to `DefaultCommercialWeighingModules` and TRULOAD-DEMO seed
- Commercial invoices use treasury gateway (not eCitizen) — eCitizen logo hidden on commercial invoice/receipt PDFs via `showSecondaryLogo` flag
- QuestPdfService detects `commercial_weighing_fee` invoice type and suppresses eCitizen branding
- Seeder sync now updates `EnabledModulesJson` for existing orgs when seed data changes

**Report Filtering - Commercial-Specific Weighing Reports**
- Enforcement-only weighing reports filtered out for commercial tenants: axle-overload, overloaded-vehicles, reweigh-statement, special-release
- Commercial tenants see only: daily-summary, weighbridge-register, compliance-trend, station-performance, transporter-statement, scale-test

**Document Generation - Tenant-Specific Branding**
- Report headers now use tenant org name and logo instead of hardcoded "REPUBLIC OF KENYA" / KURA
- `ComposeOfficialHeaderWithLogos` accepts `isEnforcement` flag — enforcement orgs show "REPUBLIC OF KENYA", commercial orgs show only their org name
- `BaseReportDocument` accepts `OrganizationName`, `IsEnforcement`, `SecondaryLogoFile` properties
- `ReportFilterParams` extended with `OrganizationName`, `OrgLogoFile`, `IsEnforcement` for pipeline-wide org context
- `BaseReportGenerator.ApplyOrgContext()` helper auto-applies org branding to report documents
- All 6 module report generators updated to use org-aware `PdfResult()` overload
